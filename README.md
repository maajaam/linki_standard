# Linki Standard

Linki is an open standard for physical medium of digital content.

Linki is a rectangular object of any material linking to online content through a NFC tag. Everybody are free to create, release, sell their own linkies for music, video, streams, games, apps etc. Linki is built on the technologies of the web - it uses URLs and NFC to combine the physical and virtual worlds.

Linkies are usable with smartphones with NFC support or with open hardware linki players. 

Linki is an open source design project initiated by artist Timo Toots and his Studio Maajaam. Collaborators welcome to join!

# Guidelines

The basic guidelines that make up a linki are following:
* Physical object from any material like wood, cardboard, metal etc. It’s better if the material is recycable. Plastics are not encouraged!
* Size 90x90mm, maximum thickness 4mm.
* Size 3.54" x 3.54", max thickness 0.157".

## URL
* URL is stored in three ways (use all if possible):        
1. NFC tag        
2. QR-code        
3. Printed as text

## Design
The design of the linki is free. There are four graphic elements to create more or less linki resemblance:
1. downward arrow
2. rectangular hole
3. two vertical lines
4. top right corner is cut


# NFC

The URL should be written on the NFC chip as message in NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF).

The NFC tag should be positioned so it’s vertical center is 23mm from bottom edge and horizontally it’s centered.
