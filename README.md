# Linki Standard

Linki is an open standard for physical medium of digital content.

Linki is a rectangular object of any material linking to online content through a NFC tag. Everybody are free to create, release, sell their own linkies for music, video, streams, games, apps etc. Linki is built on the technologies of the web - it uses URLs and NFC to combine the physical and virtual worlds.

Linkies are usable with smartphones with NFC support or with open hardware linki players. 

Linki is an open source design project initiated by artist Timo Toots and his Studio Maajaam. Collaborators welcome to join!
